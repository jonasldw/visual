Please read through, Readme.md and claude.md first

After that, scan the project, especially the folders /frontend and /backend to understand the existing foundation.

Finally, check out the latest 2-3 .md documents in .claude/plans as well as the last 2-3 commits that have been made to understand what we have been working on recently.

After that come back to me wit a quick exec summary of the project and its current status, from which we will start continue working.
