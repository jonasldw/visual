# Customer Table Field Modification
**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Duration:** Brief session  
**Status:** Completed

## Session Overview

Modified the customer table frontend to display only business-critical fields as requested by the customer: Name, Address, Last Sale Date, Birthday, and Phone.

## Primary Objectives

1. **Simplify customer table**: Remove unnecessary columns from the display
2. **Add placeholder for last sale date**: Prepare for future invoice integration
3. **Maintain functionality**: Keep edit/view actions and modal system intact

## Technical Implementations

### 1. Customer Table Column Reduction
- **File Modified**: `frontend/src/app/components/CustomersTable.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated Customer interface to include only required fields
  - Modified transformApiCustomer function to format address from components
  - Removed status-related logic and functions
- **Result**: Clean, focused table showing only business-relevant information

### 2. Address Formatting
- **Implementation**: Combined street, postal code, and city into single address field
- **Code**: 
  ```typescript
  const addressParts = []
  if (apiCustomer.address_street) addressParts.push(apiCustomer.address_street)
  if (apiCustomer.address_postal_code || apiCustomer.address_city) {
    addressParts.push(`${apiCustomer.address_postal_code || ''} ${apiCustomer.address_city || ''}`.trim())
  }
  const address = addressParts.join(', ') || 'Keine Adresse'
  ```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Table Header Translation
- **Problem**: Column headers needed German translation
- **Solution**: Used "Letzter Verkaufsdatum" for last sale date column as requested

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/app/components/CustomersTable.tsx`** - Simplified interface, removed 8 columns, added address formatting

## Key Dependencies Added/Modified

None - worked within existing React/TypeScript structure

## User Feedback Integration

- Direct customer request for specific fields: "Name | Adresse | letzter Verkaufsdatum | Geburtstag | Telefon"
- Acknowledged that "letzter Verkaufsdatum" requires invoice data not yet available

## Final Result

- ✅ Simplified customer table to 5 essential columns
- ✅ Maintained edit/view functionality
- ✅ Added placeholder for future last sale date
- ✅ Proper German localization
- ❌ Last sale date remains null (pending invoice implementation)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Business Requirements First**: Customer needs focused display over comprehensive data view
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Adding placeholder for future data integration is acceptable approach

## Impact

This modification improves usability for the optician business by focusing on the most relevant customer information for daily operations. The table is now cleaner and easier to scan, with preparation for future invoice integration.
