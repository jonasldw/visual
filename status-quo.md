# Visual Optician Business Management System - Status Quo

**Assessment Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Last Major Update:** August 18, 2025 (Products section implementation)

## Project Summary

The **Visual** optician business management system is a comprehensive solution designed for the German eyewear market, built with modern full-stack architecture and German business compliance requirements.

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python, async/await patterns
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with multi-tenancy support
- **Deployment**: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Railway

## ✅ **What's Already Built** 

### Core Infrastructure
- Complete project setup with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS
- Custom UI component system (Button, Input, Select, Icon) inspired by shadcn/ui
- API client with TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Server Actions + FastAPI integration pattern
- Multi-tenancy architecture with `organization_id`

### Customer Management (Complete)
- Full CRUD functionality with German localization
- Customer table with optical prescriptions and insurance data
- Server-side data fetching with search and pagination
- Modal-based forms with validation

### Product Management (Recently Completed - Aug 18, 2025)
- Complete CRUD functionality for frames, lenses, contacts, accessories
- German VAT compliance (19%, 7%, 0% rates)
- Product types and inventory tracking
- Search and pagination matching customer patterns
- Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility issues (searchParams as Promises)

### Technical Implementations
- Dynamic TopBar with pageConfig pattern for scalability
- Consistent navigation with active states
- Server Component + Client Component architecture
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🎯 **What's Up Next**

Based on the documentation and codebase structure, the next logical steps are:

### 1. Invoice Management System (Critical Priority)
The most important missing piece for German business compliance:
- Sequential invoice numbering (GoB compliance)
- Insurance billing with split payments
- Product snapshots in invoice items
- Multi-status workflow (draft → sent → paid/insurance_pending)

### 2. Database Schema Completion
Core tables are missing:
- `invoices` table implementation
- `invoice_items` table with product snapshots
- PostgreSQL sequences for gapless invoice numbering

### 3. German Business Features
- Tax-compliant invoice generation
- Insurance provider integration
- Historical data preservation for audits

## 🔧 **Technical Foundation**

### Established Patterns
- **Server Components**: Default for all pages with server-side data fetching
- **Server Actions**: Form handling with FastAPI backend calls
- **Client Components**: Only for interactive features (modals, forms)
- **API Integration**: Explicit JSON serialization, proper error handling
- **German Localization**: Throughout UI and business logic

### Recent Fixes (Aug 18, 2025)
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Fixed searchParams/params as Promises
- **Dynamic TopBar**: Implemented pageConfig pattern for scalability
- **Type Consistency**: Resolved string/number conversion issues from API

## 📋 **Development Standards**

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode with path aliases (`@/*` → `./src/*`)
- Custom UI components with consistent APIs
- Server-side API calls only (no direct client API calls)
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

### German Business Compliance
- Multi-tenancy with `organization_id` across all tables
- VAT rate support (19% standard, 7% reduced, 0% exempt)
- Sequential invoice numbering requirements
- Insurance billing workflow support

## 🚀 **Development Environment**

### Frontend Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Backend Commands
- `cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload` - Start dev server
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000

## 📝 **Key Documentation**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive development guidelines and patterns
- `docs/database-schema.md` - Complete database schema documentation
- `docs/api-client-guidelines.md` - TypeScript API client best practices
- `.claude/sessions/2025-08-18-products-section-implementation.md` - Recent implementation details

## 🎯 **Next Steps Assessment**

The system has a solid foundation with two complete modules (Customers, Products) and established patterns. The architectural decisions around Server Components, API patterns, and German localization are all in place and ready to be replicated for the critical invoicing system implementation.

**Ready for:** Invoice management system development following established patterns and German business compliance requirements.
