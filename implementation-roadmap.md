# OptiCRM Implementation Roadmap

IMPORTANT: All phases are only tackled step by step and for each stage the concepts are confirmed with the user before any implementation starts.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend: Next.js 15.3.3 (Current)
- App Router with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- German localization
- Real-time UI updates

### Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Async/await for database operations
- CORS configuration for Next.js frontend

### Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Customer data storage
- Real-time subscriptions
- Row-level security
- Built-in authentication

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
1. **FastAPI Setup** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Create FastAPI project structure
   - âœ… Configure CORS for Next.js frontend
   - âœ… Set up environment configuration
   - âœ… Add health check endpoint

2. **Database Schema Design** ðŸŸ¡ PARTLY COMPLETED
   - âœ… Customer table with optician-specific fields
   - Products table for inventory management
   - Appointments table for scheduling

3. **Supabase Integration** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Configure Supabase client in FastAPI
   - âœ… Set up connection pooling
   - âœ… Implement database migrations
   - âœ… Configure authentication

### Phase 2: Core API Development
1. **Customer Management API** âœ… COMPLETED & TESTED
   - âœ… `GET /api/v1/customers` - List customers with pagination/filtering
   - âœ… `POST /api/v1/customers` - Create new customer  
   - âœ… `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Get customer details
   - âœ… `PUT /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Update customer
   - âœ… `DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Soft delete customer
   - âœ… API endpoints tested and working with Supabase database

2. **Products Management API** ðŸ”µ SKIP FOR NOW
   - `GET /api/products` - List products
   - `POST /api/products` - Add new product
   - `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Update product
   - `DELETE /api/products/{id}` - Remove product

3. **Data Models (Pydantic)** âœ… COMPLETED
   ```python
   class Customer(BaseModel):
       id: Optional[int]
       first_name: str
       last_name: str
       email: Optional[str]
       phone: Optional[str]
       date_of_birth: Optional[date]
       insurance_provider: Optional[str]
       last_exam_date: Optional[date]
       next_appointment: Optional[datetime]
       prescription: Optional[str]
       status: CustomerStatus
       created_at: Optional[datetime]
       updated_at: Optional[datetime]
   ```

### Phase 3: Frontend Integration
1. **API Client Setup** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Configure axios/fetch client for FastAPI
   - Add environment variables for API base URL
   - Implement error handling and retry logic
   - Add loading states management

2. **Integrate API Client with CustomersTable** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Connect CustomersTable component to real FastAPI endpoints
   - Replace static data with API calls to display database data
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Test end-to-end data flow from database to frontend

3. **Form Components**
   - CustomerForm component with validation
   - Modal wrapper for create/edit operations
   - Connect forms to API client for create/update operations

4. **State Management**
   - React Query for server state management
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket/Server-Sent Events
   - Form state management with react-hook-form

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- API key authentication between Next.js and FastAPI
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Performance
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- API response caching
- Pagination for large datasets
- Image optimization and CDN usage

### Development Workflow
- Docker containers for local development
- API documentation with FastAPI automatic docs
- Testing strategy (unit tests for API, integration tests)
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## File Structure (Proposed)

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/ (Next.js - current implementation)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/api-client.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/ (FastAPI - to be created)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ database/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
```

## Next Immediate Steps
1. âœ… Create FastAPI backend project structure
2. âœ… Design and implement customer database schema  
3. âœ… Set up Supabase connection and basic CRUD operations
4. âœ… Create customer management API endpoints
5. Build customer creation modal and form in frontend
6. Connect frontend form to backend API
7. Implement real-time data synchronization

## Follow-up Tasks (Post-MVP - ignore for now!)

### Internationalization (i18n)
- Implement proper localization system for German language
- Create translation files for all UI text
- Translate API field names from English to German
- Support for multiple languages in the future
- Date/time formatting based on locale
- Currency and number formatting

### Real-time Features
   - Live customer data updates
   - Appointment notifications
   - Multi-user collaboration indicators
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### Additional Features
- Add sorting functionality to table
- Advanced search and filtering
- Bulk operations (import/export)
- Email notifications and reminders
- SMS integration for appointment reminders
- Customer photo management
- Prescription history tracking
- Invoice generation
- Reporting and analytics dashboard

## Success Metrics
- Customer data persists across browser sessions
- Form validation prevents invalid data entry
- Real-time updates work across multiple browser tabs
- API response times under 200ms for basic operations
- Zero data loss during concurrent user operations
